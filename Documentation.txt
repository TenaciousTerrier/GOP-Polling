Course Project: Shiny Application and Reproducible Pitch

A) What the App Does:
The Shiny App uses data from RealClearPolitics.com to display the national polling of 
2016 Republican presidential contenders since the beginning of 2015. The app allows

different candidates. Upon opening, the app defaults to showing Marco Rubio's 
position in the polls.
