Course Project: Shiny Application and Reproducible Pitch

A) What the App Does:
The Shiny App uses data from RealClearPolitics.com to display the national polling of 
2016 Republican presidential contenders since the beginning of 2015. The app allows
a user to toggle the candidates names with a checkbox grouping to display lines for 
different candidates. Upon opening, the app defaults to showing Marco Rubio's 
position in the polls.

B) Instructions for Using My Shiny Application: 
1. Go to Shiny Application URL: https://tenaciousterrier.shinyapps.io/2016GOP_Polling

2. In the right panel below the text 'Candidates', select the box or boxes for the candidates that interest you. 

3. Immediately visualize in the plot in the main panel.
